`rgeolocate` is an R package for geolocating IP addresses. It contains bindings to a variety of web APIs for IP geolocation, as well as an interface to the proprietary [MaxMind GeoIP](http://maxmind.com/) databases (and a corresponding sample database).

For the package to install properly, you'll first need [libmaxminddb](https://github.com/maxmind/libmaxminddb): the source code and installation instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/maxmind/libmaxminddb/blob/master/README.md).

## MaxMind databases

The biggest chunk of functionality is around the MaxMind proprietary databases, which you can read about [here](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-databases). `rgeolocate` has support for retrieving continent, country, region, netspeed,
and timezone information from these databases, which (unfortunately!) must be paid for if you want to access them.

MaxMind does openly release a more limited set of databases covering country and city data; these are also supported and can
be obtained [here](http://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/). To minimise the effort for the individual user, the smaller,
country-level database is included in `rgeolocate`. To demonstrate both how to use the database, and how to use the geolocation
function, we can do:

```{r}
library(rgeolocate)
file <- system.file("extdata","GeoLite2-Country.mmdb", package = "rgeolocate")
results <- maxmind("196.200.60.51", file)
results
```

The `maxmind()` function is fully vectorised and will happily geolocate around a million IP addresses in just under 5 seconds.
